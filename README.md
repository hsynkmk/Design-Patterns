# Design Patterns

A collection of Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns implemented in C# with clean examples and detailed explanations.

## üìö Patterns Catalog

### Creational Patterns

1. **[Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/01_Singleton.md)**  
   Ensures a class has only one instance while providing global access. Ideal for configuration managers and logging systems.

2. **[Factory Method Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/02_Factory_Method.md)**  
   Defers object creation to subclasses while maintaining a common interface. Enables flexible object generation.

3. **[Abstract Factory Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/03_Abstract_Factory.md)**  
   Creates families of related objects without specifying concrete classes. Perfect for cross-platform UI toolkits.

4. **[Builder Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/04_Builder.md)**  
   Constructs complex objects step-by-step. Useful for creating objects with many optional components.

5. **[Prototype Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/05_Prototype.md)**  
   Creates new objects by cloning prototypes. Efficient for expensive object initialization.

### Structural Patterns

6. **[Adapter Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/06_Adapter.md)**  
   Bridges incompatible interfaces. Commonly used in legacy system integration.

7. **[Decorator Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/07_Decorator.md)**  
   Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically. Alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

8. **[Facade Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/08_Facade.md)**  
   Provides simplified interface to complex subsystems. Reduces subsystem dependencies.

9. **[Composite Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/09_Composite.md)**  
   Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly. Ideal for tree-structured hierarchies.

10. **[Proxy Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/10_Proxy.md)**  
    Controls access to another object. Used in lazy loading and access control.

11. **[Flyweight Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/11_Flyweight.md)**  
    Minimizes memory usage through object sharing. Effective for large quantities of similar objects.

12. **[Bridge Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/12_Bridge.md)**  
    Decouples abstraction from implementation. Enables independent variation of both.

### Behavioral Patterns

13. **[Memento Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/13_Memento.md)**  
    Captures and restores object state. Essential for undo/redo functionality.

14. **[State Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/14_State.md)**  
    Encapsulates state-specific behavior. Manages object behavior changes during runtime.

15. **[Iterator Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/15_Iterator.md)**  
    Provides sequential access to collection elements. Abstracts traversal logic.

16. **[Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/16_Strategy.md)**  
    Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms. Enables runtime algorithm selection.

17. **[Template Method Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/17_Template_Method.md)**  
    Defines algorithm skeleton with customizable steps. Promotes code reuse.

18. **[Command Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/18_Command.md)**  
    Encapsulates requests as objects. Enables queuing and undo operations.

19. **[Observer Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/19_Observer.md)**  
    Implements publish-subscribe mechanism. Maintains consistency between related objects.

20. **[Mediator Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/20_Mediator.md)**  
    Centralizes complex communication between objects. Reduces direct dependencies.

21. **[Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/21_Chain_of_Responsibility.md)**  
    Passes requests through handler chain. Achieves loose coupling in request processing.

22. **[Visitor Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/22_Visitor.md)**  
    Separates algorithms from object structures. Enables adding new operations without changing classes.

23. **[Composite Pattern](https://github.com/hsynkmk/Design-Patterns/blob/main/23_Composite.md)**  
    (Note: Composite appears in both Structural and Behavioral categories based on usage context)
